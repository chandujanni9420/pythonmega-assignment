Q1. Python is called a general purpose and high-level programming language because it can be used for a wide range of tasks (general purpose) and it is relatively easy to read and write code in Python (high-level).

Q2. Python is called a dynamically typed language because data types are determined at runtime, rather than being explicitly defined by the programmer.

Q3. Pros of Python include its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is used in a wide range of applications such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Cons of Python include its performance, which may not be as fast as other languages for certain tasks, and its lack of support for some older systems.

Q4. Python can be used in a wide range of domains including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more.

Q5. A variable is a container that holds a value. In Python, variables can be declared by assigning a value to a name using the assignment operator (=).

Q6. In Python, the input() function can be used to take input from the user.

Q7. The default datatype of the value taken as input using the input() function is a string.

Q8. Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another data type. For example, converting an integer to a string.

Q9. No, we cannot take more than one input from the user using a single input() function. However, we can use the input() function multiple times to take multiple inputs.

Q10. Keywords are predefined words in a programming language that have a specific meaning and cannot be used as a variable name.

Q11. No, we cannot use keywords as a variable. This is because keywords have a specific meaning in the language and cannot be used for other purposes.

Q12. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a line of code. In Python, indentation is used to indicate the level of code nesting, such as inside a loop or inside a function.

Q13. In Python, the print() function can be used to throw some output.

Q14. Operators in Python are symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Examples include +, -, *, /, %, etc.

Q15. The / operator returns a floating point division, while the // operator returns integer division.

Q16. print("iNeuron"*4 + "iNeuron")

Q17.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num%2 == 0:
print("The number is even")
else:
print("The number is odd")

Q18. Boolean operators are the logical operations that return a boolean value (True or False) based on the given conditions. Examples include and, or, not.

Q19. 1 or 0 will return 1, 0 and 0 will return 0, True and False and True will return False, 1 or 0 or 0 will return 1

Q20. Conditional statements in Python are used to execute code based on certain conditions. They include if, elif, and else statements.

Q21. The if statement is used to execute code if a certain condition is true. The elif statement is used to check for additional conditions if the previous condition is false. The else statement is used to execute code if all previous conditions are false.

        continue
    if number > 500:
        break
    print(number)
Q26. A string is a sequence of characters in Python. We can declare a string using single, double or triple quotes. Example:


string1 = "Hello"
string2 = 'Hello'
string3 = """Hello"""
Q27. We can access the string using its index. Example:


string = "Hello"
print(string[2]) # 'l'
Q28.


string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = string.split()[2]
print(desired_output)
Q29.


string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = string.split()[2][::-1]
print(desired_output)
Q30

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(string[::-1])
Q31. We can delete the entire string using the del statement. Example:

del string
Q32. Escape sequences are used to insert special characters into strings, such as newlines (\n) and tabs (\t).

Q33.


string = "iNeuron's Big Data Course"
print(string)
Q34. A list is a collection of items in Python. It can store elements of different data types.

Q35. We can create a list in Python using square brackets [] and separating the elements with commas. Example:


lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
print(lst[4][2])

Q36. You can access elements in a list by using the index of the element. For example, if you have a list called "lst" and you want to access the first element, you can use the syntax "lst[0]".

Q37. lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
print(lst[4][2])

Q38. lst = input("Enter a list of elements: ")
print(len(lst))

Q39. lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst.insert(3, "Big")
print(lst)

Q40. A tuple is an immutable data structure in Python, similar to a list. However, elements in a tuple cannot be modified once they are created.

Q41. You can create a tuple in Python by using parentheses () and separating the elements with commas. For example, my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

Q42. No, we cannot add elements to a tuple once it is created because it is immutable.

Q43. Yes, two tuples can be appended.
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)

Q44. tuple1 = input("Enter a tuple of elements: ")
print(len(tuple1))

Q45. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements in Python. They are defined using curly braces {} or the set() function.

Q46. You can create a set by using curly braces {} or the set() function. For example, my_set = {1, 2, 3} or my_set = set([1, 2, 3])

Q47. my_set = set()
my_set.add("iNeuron")
print(my_set)

Q48. my_set = set()
my_set.add(1)
my_set.add(2)
my_set.add(3)
print(my_set)

Q49. The add() function is used to add a single element to a set, while the update() function is used to add multiple elements to a set at once.

Q50. The clear() function is used to remove all elements from a set.

Q51. A frozen set is an immutable version of a set. Once a frozen set is created, its elements cannot be modified.

Q52. A frozen set is similar to a set but it's immutable and one can not perform add or remove operations on it.

Q53. The union() function is used to combine two sets and return a new set containing all elements from both sets.

set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

Q54. The intersection() function is used to return a new set containing only the elements that are common to both sets.

set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set3)

Q55. A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. It allows for efficient retrieval of values by their keys.

Q56. Dictionaries are different from other data structures because they use keys to access values instead of indices. This allows for more efficient value retrieval and allows keys to have any immutable type as a value.

Q57. A dictionary can be declared in Python using curly braces {} or the dict() constructor. For example:
var = {}
var = dict()

Q58. The output of the following code will be:
<class 'dict'>

Q59. An element can be added to a dictionary by assigning a value to a new key, or by using the update() method. For example:
d = {'a': 1}
d['b'] = 2
d.update({'c': 3})

Q60. A dictionary can be created and accessed as follows:
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(d.values())

Q61. A nested dictionary can be created and accessed as follows:
d = {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}, 'd': {'e': 3, 'f': 4}}
print(d['a']['b'])

Q62. The get() function is used to retrieve the value of a specified key in a dictionary, and returns None if the key is not found.

Q63. The items() function returns a view object that contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary.

Q64. The pop() function is used to remove a specified key and its associated value from a dictionary, and returns the value.

Q65. The popitem() function is used to remove and return an arbitrary key-value pair from a dictionary.

Q66. The keys() function returns a view object that contains the keys of the dictionary.

Q67. The values() function returns a view object that contains the values of the dictionary.

Q68. Loops in Python are used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list or a string.

Q69. There are two types of loops in Python: for and while.

Q70. A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list or a string, and a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met.

Q71. The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.

Q72. The break statement is used to exit a loop before its normal termination.

Q73. The pass statement is used as a placeholder in a loop or a function definition, and does nothing when executed.

Q74. The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers, and is commonly used in for loops to specify the number of iterations.

Q75. A dictionary can be looped over by using a for loop to iterate over its keys or items. For example:
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in d:
print(key, d[key])
